    <h2>Company History</h2>
      <img src="images/funkoHQ.jpg" alt="Outside of Funko HQ in Everett, Washington with large Funko pops around the building">
      <p>Funko was founded in 1998 by toy collector Mike Becker at his home in Snohomish, Washington. 
	He started the business after failing to find an affordable coin bank of the Big Boy Restaurants mascot, 
	instead licensing the rights to make his own coin banks from a Big Boy franchise in Michigan. The coin banks 
	failed to sell and the franchise filed for bankruptcy protection, but Funko remained in business after licensing 
	the rights to bobbleheads for Austin Powers, which sold 80,000 units. In 2005, Becker sold Funko to its 
	current Chief Creative Officer, Brian Mariotti, who moved its offices to Lynnwood, Washington, and significantly 
	expanded the company's licensed product lines. In 2011, Funko began selling their Pop! Vinyl line of 
	figurines. By 2012, the company had sold more than $20 million worth of merchandise. </p>
