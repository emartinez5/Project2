  <h2>Different Variants of Spidey</h2>
    <h3>Peter Parker</h3>
      <img src="images/peteSpider.jpg" alt="Peter Parker unmasked in his spider suit thinking">
	<p>Sometimes student, sometimes scientist and sometimes photographer, Peter Parker is a full-time super hero 
	better known as the web-slinging and wall-crawling Spider-Man. As an orphaned child, Peter was raised by his 
	Uncle Ben and Aunt May. At a science expo, Peter was bitten by an errant radioactive spider which granted 
	him an array of arachnid powers.</p>
    <h3>Miles Morales</h3>
      <img src="images/milesSpider.jpg" alt="Miles Morales in Spiderman suit in action landing pose">
        <p>Miles Morales is a teenager from Brooklyn who was bitten by a Genetically Altered Spider and became Earth-1610's 
	Spider-Man following the death of that reality's Peter Parker.</p>
    <h3>Miguel O'hara</h3>
      <img src="images/miguelSpider.jpg" alt="Miguel O'hara in Spiderman suit flying through the air with lightning in the background">
        <p>Miguel O'Hara, an engineer of Irish and Mexican descent, was born after his mother Conchata had an affair with her 
	husband's boss Tyler Stone, though grew up believing his stepfather was also his biological father. 
	As an adult, he worked for Alchemax. He was less than pleased at the corporation's vast control over the city. A 
	genius in the field of genetics, he was being pressured by Tyler Stone to test a process to imprint genetic codes into 
	human physiology. He reluctantly tried the process on a test subject named Mr. Sims. It was a failure - Sims was transformed 
	into a hideous creature and quickly died. This was the last straw for Miguel: he went to Stone and attempted to hand in his 
	notice. Stone gave and Miguel accepted a drink which, unknown to Miguel had been laced with the highly addictive 
	hallucinogenic drug that bonds to the victim's DNA, called Rapture. As Alchemax was sole manufacturer of the drug, 
	Stone expected that Miguel would be forced to remain with the company. In an attempt to rid himself of the hallucinogen, 
	Miguel decided to try the genetic procedure, which had killed Sims, on himself, as he had input his own original genetic 
	code as a baseline. The process was sabotaged by his supervisor, Aaron Delgato, in the attempt to kill him (the incident 
	would be covered up as an accident). Miguel survived the process; his DNA was spliced with the genes of a spider and gained 
	several powers, though he lost his addiction to Rapture.</p>
    <h3>Cindy Moon</h3>

        <p>As a child, her parents found out that Cindy had an eidetic memory. Her mother wanted her to focus on her studies 
	while Cindy would rather continue playing on her school hockey team with her secret boyfriend, Hector Cervantez. When 
	her mother found out, she was forced to go to the school field trip to General Techtronics and Cin told her she hated 
	her. Sometime later, Cindy broke up with Hector since he was going to Boston College and she was going to Oxford 
	University.When attending a public exhibition demonstrating the safe handling of nuclear laboratory waste materials, 
	a spider irradiated by a particle accelerator used in the demonstration bit Peter Parker on the hand and fell from 
	his hand, it then bit Cindy on her ankle before dying.</p>
    <h3>Jessica Drew</h3>
      <img src="images/jessicaSpider.png" alt="Jessica Drew in Spiderwoman suit falling with leaves around her">
        <p>Born in 1924, Jessica Drew traveled with her parents, Jonathan and Miriam, to Mount Wundagore, in the small
	Balkan nation of Transia. There, Jonathan conducted genetics research with Dr. Herbert Wyndham, who would later 
	become the armored man-god known as the High Evolutionary. At seven years old, Jessica contracted uranium 
	poisoning from her father’s work, but Jonathan and Wyndham saved her life through a spider-derived serum and 
	years of hibernation in a genetic accelerator. Jessica spent decades in stasis, receiving subliminal education 
	via special tapes. When she was finally awakened, she was cured, and had aged only to her early teens. She also 
	discovered that she now possessed super human powers—a result of the combination of the radiation exposure and 
	the spider-serum.</p>
